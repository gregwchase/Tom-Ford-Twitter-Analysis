The fashion industry changes season to season. A collection can be designed, but the customer should always be the priority. More importantly, what are they saying? What do they think of the new collection? How likely are they to buy an item? What item(s) generated the most "buzz" in the overall collection? All questions a fashion house would want answers to.

This project attempts to answer the question: what are people talking about in relation to the brand TOM FORD?
